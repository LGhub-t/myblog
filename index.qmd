# Welcome

This is my open notebook — a space to explore, document, and share ideas from my research, teaching, and ongoing learning in macroeconometrics, data science, and economic thought.

The goal isn’t to publish polished pieces, but to build a living archive of working notes: structured, revisitable, and slowly evolving. Some pages are technical; others more intuitive or reflective. All are part of a journey toward deeper understanding.
