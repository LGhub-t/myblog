This blog is an experiment in quiet knowledge building.

Most entries are drawn from my current projects in macroeconomics, econometrics, and teaching â€” particularly on topics like structural models, Bayesian inference, dimensionality reduction, and growth theory.

It's a personal project, but one I hope will resonate with others navigating similar intellectual paths.
