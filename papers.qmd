This page presents my academic publications and current research projects in macroeconomics. My work focuses on external imbalances, fiscal policy, structural heterogeneity, and the dynamics of global economic shocks.

## Publications

### üìÑ [Spatial Dependence, Social Networks, and Economic Structures in Japanese Regional Labor Migration](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14031865)

*Sustainability*, 2022, 14(3), 1865.\
This paper examines how spatial dependence, social networks, and economic structures shape internal labor migration patterns in Japan. Using spatial econometric models, it highlights the complex interplay between regional labor flows and structural characteristics.

### üìÑ [Is Inflation Fiscally Determined?](https://doi.org/10.3390/su132011306)

*Sustainability*, 2021, 13(20), 11306.\
This paper investigates the relationship between fiscal policy and inflation for 44 countries from 1960 to 2020. Using panel data analysis, it explores whether inflation dynamics can be explained by fiscal dominance, providing evidence across advanced and developing economies.

## Working Papers

### üìù Global Shocks, Local Structures: Mapping the Anatomy of External Adjustment

This paper examines how structural differences in countries‚Äô external sector configurations shape their macroeconomic responses to global shocks. Using principal component analysis (PCA) on detailed balance-of-payments and trade specialization data for over 150 countries, it constructs a low-dimensional typology of external structures‚Äîcapturing reliance on external income flows, foreign direct investment, trade composition, and vulnerability to essential import needs. The paper then estimates local projections of the current account response to three standardized global shocks: geopolitical risk, world industrial production, and commodity prices. Results reveal sharp asymmetries: geopolitical and output shocks disproportionately affect countries reliant on FDI or remittance flows, while commodity shocks generate textbook terms-of-trade effects, benefiting exporters and penalizing structurally vulnerable importers. The findings highlight the importance of structural heterogeneity in external adjustment and call for more tailored approaches to external risk assessment and macroeconomic policy design.
